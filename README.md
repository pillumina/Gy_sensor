# Building Occupancy Pattern

This project focus on developing an occupancy monitoring system by utilizing infrared array sensors. The low resolution sensors
have less intrusion of privacies when compared with high resolution sensors like RGB cameras.

-------------------------------
## Goals of the Project

This project consists of three main parts:
+ Occupancy detection
+ Occupancy counting
+ Occupancy tracking

### Occupancy Detection

-----------------------------------------------
## To Dos:
1. add API for new firmware
2. add test cases
3. refine detection algorithm

-------------------------------
## How to Contribute

Once the package is developed and more mature in structure and usability we will include a link to the git How-to guide and openly accept well documented changes.
